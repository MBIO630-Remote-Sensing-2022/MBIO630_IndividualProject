## Introduction to using R Markdown documents

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button above, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

#### Code chunks

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

#### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Final project goals

* Help students address a question related to their interest that can be answered using remote sensing	
* Provide experience with developing and refining research questions	
* Provide experience with proposal development and writing	
* Provide experience with manuscript-writing 	
* Provide experience with giving presentations	
* (potentially) Form the seed of a publishable manuscript / thesis chapter

## Final project guidelines

* You will write up your project as a 'mini-paper', i.e., a shorter and less formal version of a manuscript you'd submit for publication
        - If you're new to writing manuscripts, [this is a handy guide](https://conservationbytes.com/2012/10/22/how-to-write-a-scientific-paper/) that lays out the process in clear steps 
* Text length (excluding references) should be between 2000-3000 words 
* Format should follow standard scientific writing sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion)
* You should include 3-6 figures or display items of some sort
* You can include references as needed (i.e., where it supports what you're saying), but there is no minimum number of references you need in whichever sort of standard reference format you like (one example is in the [journal "Nature"'s formatting guidelines](https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/formatting-guide)). 
* How to set up and turn in your project:  
    + Write your project as a R Markdown document in a project folder setup as we've done in the course up to now
        - If you're new to RMarkdown, use the cheat sheets in the "info" folder to help with your write-up
    + Follow the [data and code tutorial found here](https://jmadinlab.github.io/data_code_tutorial/) to both know how to set up your project folder structure (this is just for your benefit and won't be graded, but will help you) 
    + Upload it as a new repository in YOUR Github workspace (not the course github workspace)
    + The link above also gives step-by-step instructions for how to get your project set up with git and uploaded to Github
        - If you have trouble with git/Github after following the steps in this guide, reach out to one of the instructors. 
    + You will turn your project in by uploading it to Github and adding me as a collaborator
        - in your repo, do this by: Settings -> Collaborators (left hand side bar) -> Add People (green button)
    + Due date: Oct. 19, 5 pm

## Template for final project

When you feel relatively comfortable in creating your R Markdown (.Rmd) document and are ready to insert your text, figures, and any tables or analyses, you can delete everything above, from this section through "## Introduction to using R Markdown documents" and use the rest of this document as your template for your final project write-up (so you don't have to create it from scratch, since R Markdown is new to some of you).
 
## Abstract

(insert your text here)

## Introduction 

(insert your text here)

## Methods

(insert your text here)

## Results

(insert your figures, tables (if any), and text here; example of code chunks are given below so you can use this format and insert your own code in place of the example code)

```{r analysis chunk 1}
summary(cars)
```

```{r plots chunk 1, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Discussion
